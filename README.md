=========

This app makes it easier to distribute the logistics of a show to your bandmates. I used to use a facebook thread to announce show details and find out availability, but we also used the same thread for general chit-chat, which made people miss out on important show announcements.

Ultimately, you'll be able to log in, submit a show (with details like date, venue, payment, etc), and wait for your bandmates to confirm their availability and interest. Once everyone accepts, the show will be pushed to your Google calendar.

This app uses AngularJS, Firebase, and Angularfire.
